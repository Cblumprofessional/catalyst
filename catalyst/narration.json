        "narration": "Ash drifts on the wind, soft as snow, bitter as loss. The kingdoms have fallen, splintered beneath the weight of something ancient, something forgotten. No war was won. No peace was earned. Only The Sundering remains, a wound in time and stone, carved by powers that should never have stirred. They called it the Catalyst, a relic buried before the world had names. Some sought to control it. Others tried to destroy it. All failed. Now, only fragments remain. Shattered lands. Fading stars. Hollow faiths. You awaken in a scorched cradle of earth, the sky bleeding ash above. You remember nothing, not your name, not your purpose. Only the burn of a symbol etched upon your flesh... and a whisper echoing from the dark: You were not meant to survive... and yet, here you are. The world does not know you. But it will remember you. Welcome, lost soul. Step forward. The Catalyst stirs again."
